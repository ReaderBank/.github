# ReaderBank
The world’s most ambitious study of reading, imagination and well-being.

**- How do people imagine when reading?**

**- How are fictional characters represented in the mind?**

**- What can the reading experience tell us about our health and wellbeing?**

The ReaderBank aims to answer these questions. 

In collaboration with Edinburgh International Book Festival, and hosted at Durham University’s Institute for Medical Humanities, the ReaderBank houses a collection of scientific data surrounding reading experiences and imagination.
